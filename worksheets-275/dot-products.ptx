        <p>
          Find a nonzero vector that is perpendicular to <m>(v_1, v_2)</m>. (<em>Hint.</em>
          Your answer will be in terms of <m>(v_1, v_2)</m>.)

        <p>
          Find two nonzero vectors that are perpendicular to <m>(v_1, v_2, v_3)</m>. (<em>Hint.</em>
          Can you use your idea from the previous part?)

    <statement>
      <p>
        Find a vector that is perpendicular to all <m>2</m>-dimensional vectors.
        Then find a vector that is parallel to all <m>3</m>-dimensional vectors.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Write down the unit vectors whose angle from the vector
        <m>\angl{1,0}</m> is <m>\theta</m> (in the positive direction).
        Then write down <em>all</em>
        vectors at this angle. (All your answers will involve <m>\theta</m>.)

  <task workspace="10%">
    <p>
      What is the sum <m>\vec{V}</m> of the twelve vectors from the center of a clock to the hours?
    </p>
  </task>

  <task workspace="10%">
    <p>
      If the 4 o'clock vector is removed,
      find <m>\vec{V}</m> for the other eleven vectors.
    </p>
  </task>

  <task workspace="10%">
    <p>
      If the vectors to <m>1</m>, <m>2</m>, <m>3</m> are cut in half
      (but <m>4</m> is put back),
      find <m>\vec{V}</m> for the twelve vectors.
