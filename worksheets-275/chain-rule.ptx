    <statement>
      <p>
        Use the chain rule to solve the problems.
        You will need to relate the evident variables first.

      <task workspace="10%">
        <p>
          At <m>t = 0</m>, Nurl starts filling a snow-cone such that its height
          grows at a rate <m>dh/dt = 1</m> and <m>dr/dt = 2</m>.
          At what rate is the volume
          increasing when <m>t = 3</m>?

  <task workspace="10%">
    <p>
      If a rocket has speed <m>dx/dt = 6</m> down range and <m>dy/dt = 2t</m>
      upward, how fast is it moving away from the launch point at <m>(0,0)</m>?
      How
      fast is the angle <m>\theta</m> changing,
      if <m>\tan{\theta} = y/x</m>?
      (<em>Hint.</em> Differentiate
      <m>\tan{\theta}</m> implicitly with respect to
      <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.)
    </p>
  </task>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>r^2 = x^2 + y^2</m>.
        (This is Strang's favorite example.)
      </p>

      <task workspace="10%">
        <p>
          Show that
          <me>
            \frac{\dee^2 r}{\dee x^2} = \frac{y^2}{r^3}
          </me>
          directly, by finding <m>\dfrac{\dee}{\dee x} \dfrac{\dee r}{\dee x}</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now use the chain rule to derive the same result.
          Start by recalling
          from your calculations above that <m>\dfrac{\dee r}{\dee x} = \dfrac{x}{r}</m>,
          then differentiate both sides implicitly with respect to <m>x</m>.
