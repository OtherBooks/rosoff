    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f_1(x,y) = x^2/(x^2 + y^2)</m>.
        Find the limit of <m>f_1(x,y)</m> as
        <m>(x,y) \to (0,0)</m> along the <m>x</m>-axis.
        In other words,
        find the (ordinary, 1-dimensional) limit of a suitable "slice function" obtained from <m>f_1</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The slice function is <m>f_1(x,0) = x^2/x^2</m>.
        Taking the limit, we find
        <me>
          \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{x^2}{x^2} = \lim_{x\to 0} \frac{1}{1} = 1
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <q>cancellation</q>
        <m>x^2/x^2 = 1</m> is valid when <m>x \ne 0</m>,
        so the two functions have the same limit at <m>0</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Find the limit of <m>f_1(x,y)</m> as <m>(x,y) \to (0,0)</m> as
        <m>(x,y) \to (0,0)</m> along the <m>y</m>-axis,
        again using a slice function.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The slice function is <m>f_1(0,y) = 0/y^2</m>.
        Taking the limit, we find
        <me>
          \lim_{y\to 0} \frac{0}{y^2} = \lim_{x\to 0} 0 = 0
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <q>simplification</q>
        <m>0/y^2</m> is valid when <m>y \ne 0</m>,
        so the two functions have the same limit at <m>0</m>.
      </p>

  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Does <m>\lim\limits_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} f_1 (x,y)</m> exist?
        Why?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        It does not,
        because the one-dimensional limits obtained above do not agree.
      </p>
    </solution>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Now let <m>f_2(x,y) = xy/(x^2 + y^2)</m>.
        Show that the limit of <m>f_2(x,y)</m> as
        <m>(x,y) \to (0,0)</m> along either coordinate axis is 0.
      </p>

          Does <m>\lim\limits_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} f_2 (x,y)</m> exist?
          Why do you think so?

          Finally, let <m>f_3(x,y) = x^2 y/(x^4 + y^2)</m>.
          Show that the limit as <m>(x,y) \to (0,0)</m> along every line through the origin is <m>0</m>.

        <p>
          Show that, nevertheless,
          <m>\lim\limits_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} f_3 (x,y)</m> does not exist by letting <m>(x,y)</m> approach the origin along a suitable curve.
