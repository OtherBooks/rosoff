        A good name for the derivative of <c>y</c> would be <c>yp</c>,
        since the prime <m>'</m> is unavailable as a character in the name of an R variable.
        Use the <c>D</c> command to store the derivative of <c>y</c> in <c>yp</c> and record the R command(s) you used below.

        Tia is speeding down Route 0 in her cool red Fiat when her radar system warns her of an obstacle<nbsp />\si{180}{m} ahead.
        She applies the brakes to slow down.
        Her speed decreases throughout the 10 seconds it takes the car to stop,
        but it doesn't necessarily decrease at a uniform rate.

          Subdivide the <m>t</m>-axis into five equal parts,
          and mark a <m>t</m>-value in each part.
          Use the speed from each <m>t</m>-value as the height of a rectangle.
          You should have five rectangles, all of width <m>2</m>.

          As coal deposits are depleted,
          it becomes necessary to strip-mine larger areas for each additional ton of coal gathered.
          The figure shows the number of acres per million tons,
          <m>A(t)</m>,
          that will be defaced as a function of the number of million tons removed, <m>t</m>.
          In this problem,
          you will estimate the number of acres defaced in removing the next 4 million tons of coal.
