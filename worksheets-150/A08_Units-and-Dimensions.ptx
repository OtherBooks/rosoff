    <statement>
      <p>
        A joule (<m>\SI{1}{J}</m>) is an amount of energy.
        A watt is a rate at which energy is used,
        defined to be <m>\SI{1}{J/s}</m>.
      </p>

      <task workspace="20%">
        <p>
          How many joules of energy are required to run a
          <m>\SI{100}{W}</m> light bulb for one day?
        </p>

      <task workspace="10%">
        <p>
          Burning coal yields about <m>\SI{30d6}{J}</m> of energy
          per kilogram of coal burned.
          Assuming that a coal power plant is
          30<percent /> efficient, how much coal has to be burned to light the bulb
          for a day?

        Growing Corn

    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Assume that sunlight deposits energy on a cornfield at the rate of <m>\SI{250}{W/m^2}</m>,
        averaging over the day-night cycle.
        There are <m>\SI{4.186}{J}</m> in a calorie.
      </p>

      <task workspace="20%">
        <p>
          How much energy
          (in calories)
          is deposited on a square meter of field over the 4-month growing season?
        </p>

      <task workspace="20%">
        <p>
          In good growing conditions,
          farmers can grow approximately 12500 ears of sweet corn per acre.
          Use this to estimate the amount of sunlight energy per ear of corn.
        </p>
      </task>

      <task workspace="10%">
        <p>
          Nutrition labels for corn indicate that there are roughly 120 calories in an ear of corn.
          The word <q>calories</q>,
          when you see it on a food label,
          actually means <q>kilocalories</q>.
          That is, the 120 labeled calories corresponds to 120,000 true calories,
          or 120 kcal.
          Compare sunlight energy with the corn energy to get an efficiency in percent.

    Building Hoover Dam
  </p>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The Hoover Dam produces <m>\SI{2d9}{W}</m> of electricity energy.
        It is composed of <m>\SI{7d9}{kg}</m> of concrete.
        To produce <m>\SI{1}{kg}</m> of concrete requires <m>\SI{1}{MJ}</m> of energy.
      </p>

      <task workspace="20%">
        <p>
          How much energy did it take to produce the concrete in the dam?

      <task workspace="20%">
        <p>
          How long is the <q>energy payback time</q>
          for the dam? (Give your answer in years.)

        <p>
          The area of Lake Mead, formed by Hoover Dam, is <m>247\;\mathrm{
          mi}^2</m>.
          Assuming that <m>\SI{250}{W/m^2}</m> of sunlight energy (on
          average) falls on Lake Mead,
          how much power could you produce if instead of the lake you installed solar cells with 12<percent /> efficiency?
          Give your answer in Watts.

    <statement>
      <p>
        If we don't want to specify units,
        we can still talk about the <em>dimensions</em> of quantities.
        Dimensions are things like length <m>L</m>, time <m>T</m>,
        temperature <m>\theta</m>, mass <m>M</m>, and so on.
        We use [square brackets] to indicate the dimension of a unit:
        for example,
        the dimension of meter is length, or <m>[\si{m}] = L</m>.
      </p>

      <task workspace="10%">
        <p>
          A joule is defined to be <m>\SI{1}{J} = \SI{1}{kg.m^2/s^2}</m>.
          What is the dimension of this quantity?
          Express your answer as a <em>product of integer powers</em>
          of the dimensions given above.
        </p>

        <p>
          What is the dimension of the energy delivery unit
          <m>\si{W/m^2}</m> that appears in the previous problems?
