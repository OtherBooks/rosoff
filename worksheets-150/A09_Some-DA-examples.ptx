      <title>The pendulum</title>
      <p>
        A pendulum has a certain period,
        the time it takes to complete a back-and-forth cycle.
        Use the method of dimensional analysis sometimes called Buckingham Pi to find a relationship involving the period.
        Hint: The variables to consider are the period, <m>P</m>,
        the length of the pendulum, <m>l</m>, the mass of the pendulum,
        <m>m</m>, and the acceleration due to gravity, <m>g</m>.

    <statement>
      <title>A day at the races</title>
      <p>
        A car drives around and around a circular path.
        The occupants perceive a force pushing the car outward.
        Now physicists will tell you this centrifugal force is only an apparent force,
        and the real force is the centripetal force of the tires pushing the car inward to keep it on the circular path.
        Either way,
        we can find a relationship to describe the magnitude of either of these forces.
      </p>

      <p>
        The variables involved seem to be the force itself,
        <m>F</m>, the radius of the circular path, <m>r</m>,
        the car's speed, <m>v</m>, and the mass of the car, <m>m</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Find a formula for <m>F</m> in terms of the other variables using the Buckingham Pi method. [Remember,
        force = mass <times /> acceleration.]
