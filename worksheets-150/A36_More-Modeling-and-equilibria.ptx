    <statement>
      <p>
        A company earns <m>2\%</m> per month on its assets, paid continuously,
        and its expenses are paid out continuously at a rate of <m>\dollar80,000</m> per month.
      </p>

      <task workspace="10%">
        <p>
          Write a differential equation for the value, <m>V</m>,
          of the company as a funtion of time, <m>t</m>, in months.

          What is the equilibrium solution?
          What is the significance of this value to the company?

    <statement>
      <p>
        A patient is given the drug theophylline intervenously at a rate of <m>43.2</m> mg/hour to relieve acute asthma.
        The rate at which the drug leaves the patient's body is proportional to the quantity there,
        with proportionality constant <m>0.082</m> where time,
        <m>t</m>,
        is in hours.
        The patient's body contains none of the drug initially.
      </p>

      <task workspace="10%">
        <p>
          Describe in words how you expect the quantity of the theophylline in the patient to vary over time.
        </p>
      </task>

      <task workspace="10%">
        <p>
          Write a differential equation satisfied by the quantity of drug in the body,
          <m>Q(t)</m>.
