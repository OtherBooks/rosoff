        <em>(Final exam, spring 2014)</em>
        A fluid whose density is <m>\rho</m> drains through a hole at the bottom of a cylindrical tank of height <m>h</m>.
        Use dimensional analysis to express the speed of the exiting fluid,
        <m>v</m>, in terms of <m>\rho</m>,
        <m>h</m>, and the acceleration due to gravity, <m>g</m>.
        Your answer should include an unknown dimensionless constant. (<em>Hint</em>.<nbsp />The dimension of <m>\rho</m> is <m>ML^{-3}</m>.)

          One formula for the force of gravity, <m>F_g</m>,
          exerted by Earth on some object is
          <me>
            F_g = \frac{G m m_E}{r^2}
          </me>,
          where <m>m</m> is the mass of the object, <m>m_E</m> is the mass of
          Earth, <m>r</m> is the distance between the center of Earth
          and the center of the object,
          and <m>G</m> is the so-called
          <em>gravitational constant</em>.
          Find the units of <m>G</m>. <em>Hint.</em>
          Recall that <m>\text{ force }  = \text{ mass }  \times \text{ acceleration }</m>.

    \paragraph{Estimation nation} Throughout the applications of math,
    it's important to be able to come up with reasonable estimates based on incomplete information,
    or even guesses.
    Successful scientists, engineers,
    and business people need to do this regularly,
    as does most anyone who uses numbers to help them make plans of any kind.
