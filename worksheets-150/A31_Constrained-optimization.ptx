    Using the ideas of the previous question,
    it is possible to locate and classify the
    constrained optima of a function graphically.
    Here we illustrate how to achieve this
    in R Studio.
    Consider the problem of maximizing the objective function
    <me>
      f(x,y) = xy  \text{ such that }    x + 2y = -4
    </me>.
  </p>
  <exercise workspace="10%">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Solve the constraint equation <m>x+2y=-4</m> for <m>y</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <exercise workspace="10%">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Use the <c>plotFun</c> command to plot the graph of the constraint equation over the interval <m>-5\leq x\leq 5</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </exercise>
  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Once you are looking at the graph of the constraint equation,
        use <c>plotFun</c> to create a new plot,
        this time of <m>f</m>. <c>plotFun( f(x,y) <m>\sim</m> x<ampersand />y,
        add=TRUE, filled=FALSE, levels=pretty(range(-8,8), 8) )</c> The last parameter asks R to include around 8 contours in the indicated range.
        The parameter
      </p>

      <p>
        <c>levels=pretty(range(-8,8), 16)</c>
      </p>

      <p>
        will produce twice as many.
      </p>

      <p>
        \fullwidth{By looking at the graphs of <m>f(x,y)</m> along with the constraint equation,
        you can see that the largest value for the objective function is <m>f(x,y) = 2</m>,
        where the constraint function is tangent to the contour of the objective function.
        Evidently, this occurs near <m>x = -2</m>,
        <m>y = -1</m>. (In fact, that is the exact location of the maximum,
        but usually the coordinates will not be whole numbers.) If you want a more precise answer,
        you can zoom in on the region of interest.
        If the relevant contour happens not to be one of those drawn in the contour plot, You'll have to interpolate.
        You can use <c>levels=c(a)</c> in a <c>plotFun()</c> with <c>add=TRUE</c> to add a single contour at level<nbsp /><m>a</m>. }

        Use the techniques outlined above to find the optimal points for the objective function
        <m>f(x,y) = 3x^2 + 4y^2</m> on the curve <m>x+2y = 3</m>.
        The space below is left blank for you to make any notes you might find useful in repeating this procedure later.
