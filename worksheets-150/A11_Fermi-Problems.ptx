      <title>How many bicycle mechanics live in Boise?</title>
      <p>
        This problem is based on a famous problem attributed to the great Fermi himself.
        You can use the ideas and techniques of the last few activities to break down this seemingly intractable estimation problem into a sequence of more reasonable ones.
        You might still have to guess at a few values of consequence,
        but that is part of the process.
        You'll be able to look some of them up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Look up in a credible source or estimate each of the following values.
        Make sure to include appropriate units with each value.
        Most bicycle enthusiasts agree that a bicycle should be tuned at least once per year to maintain proper function.

    <em>In these problems,
    you'll need to determine the breakdown of the pertinent quantity into separate dimensions yourself.
    Use common sense, look things up when you can,
    and estimate when you have to.</em>
