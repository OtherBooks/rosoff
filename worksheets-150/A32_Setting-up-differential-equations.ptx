        A cup of coffee contains about
        <quantity><mag>100</mag><unit prefix="mili" base="gram"/></quantity>
        of caffeine.
        Caffeine is metabolized and leaves the body at a continuous rate of about
        <quantity><mag>17</mag><unit base="percent"/></quantity>
        every hour.
      </p>

      <task workspace="10%">
        <p>
          Write a differential equation for the amount, <m>A</m>,
          of caffeine
          in the body as a function of the number of hours, <m>t</m>,
          since the
          coffee was consumed.

          Use the differential equation to find <m>dA/dt</m> at the start of
          the first hour

          Use your answer

          hour.

        Keep in mind the following two precepts to guide your thinking:

        <ol type="i">
          <li>
            <p>
              You are writing down a <em>differential equation</em>, not a
              formula for the quantity of interest.

          <li>
            <p>
              The net rate of change of the quantity may be easily expressed
              as a difference of the form:
              <m>\mathbf{\text{ rate } _{\text{ in } } - \text{ rate } _{\text{ out } }}</m>.

        A population of insects grows at a rate proportional to the size of the population.
        Write a differential equation for the size of the population,
        <m>P</m>,
        as a function of time, <m>t</m>.
        Is the constant of proportionality positive or negative?

        Radioactive substances decay at a rate proportional to the
        amount of the substance that is present.

        for the quantity, <m>Q</m>,
