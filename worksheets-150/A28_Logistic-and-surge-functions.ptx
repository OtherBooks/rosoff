      <p>
        Quantities that grow quickly for a while and then level off are well modeled by
        <em>logistic</em> functions.
        One example is the percentage, <m>P(t)</m>,
        of US households with cable television where <m>t</m> is in years since <m>1979</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        From data collected,
        a best-fitting logistic function for the tabulated data is shown below.

        Epidemiologists must model the spread of pathogens through populations.
        Your team will model the total number of people infected with a virus,
        <m>P</m>,
        by a logistic function <m>P(t) = L/(1+Ce^{-kt})</m>, with <m>t</m> in weeks.
        Suppose that there are 10 patients initially and that early observations indicate a continuous growth rate of <m>1.78</m>.
        Epidemiologists predict that the maximum infection rate is <m>80\%</m> of the Treasure Valley,
        or about <m>\num{160000}</m> people.

        Drug concentration in the bloodstream is often well modeled by a surge function.
        Surge functions all have the form <m>y = ate^{-bt}</m>.
        They increase rapidly and then decay toward 0 with a maximum value at <m>t = 1/b</m>.
        The concentration, <m>C</m><nbsp />(in <m>\si{ng/mL}</m>),
        of a drug in a certain patient's bloodstream is given by <m>C(t) = 20te^{-0.09t}</m>.
