        A disease is said to be highly <em>infectious</em> if it is
        relatively easy for a susceptible person to become infected.
        How would
        you modify the parameters <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in the <m>SIR</m> model to
        account for infectiousness?
        In which direction?

        The value <m>b/a</m> is called the
        <em>threshold value</em>
        for the system.
        If the initial susceptible population is greater
        than this threshold value, then the <m>SIR</m> model predicts
        an epidemic.

          Suppose that the initial susceptible population is a
          little <em>less</em> than <m>b/a</m>.
          Use the <m>SI</m>-equations to
          show that initially, the infected population is decreasing.
          Use <m>a=0.002</m> and <m>b=0.8</m>.
