      <p>
        Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells are one of the world's
        fastest-growing energy source.
        The rate of solar PV production, <m>S</m>,
        in gigawatts per year,
        is approximated by <m>S(t)=0.277e^{0.368t}</m>, where
        <m>t</m> is in years since 2000.
      </p>

      <task workspace="10%">
        <p>
          Write down the definite integral that gives the total solar PV
          production between <m>2000</m> and <m>2010</m>.

      <p>
        A forest fire covers 2000 acres at time <m>t=0</m>.
        The fire grows at the
        rate of <m>8\sqrt{t}</m> acres per hour,
        where <m>t</m> is in hours.
        (Note: an acre is
