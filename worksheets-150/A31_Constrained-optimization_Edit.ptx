        Using the ideas of the previous question,
        it is possible to locate and classify the
        constrained optima of a function graphically.
        Here we illustrate how to achieve this
        in R Studio.
        Consider the problem of maximizing the objective function
        <me>
          f(x,y) = xy  \text{ such that }    x + 2y = -4
        </me>.
      </p>

      <task workspace="10%">
        <p>
          Solve the constraint equation
          <m>x+2y=-4</m> for <m>y</m>.
        </p>

        <task xml:id="plot_constraint">
          <p>
            Use the <c>plotFun</c> command
            to plot the graph of the constraint
            equation.
          </p>

          <task xml:id="add_contours">
            <p>
              Once you are looking at the graph of the
              constraint equation,
              use <c>plotFun</c> to add some
              contours of <m>f</m> to the picture.
              Use a command like the following:
              <c>plotFun( f(x,y) <m>\sim</m> x<ampersand />y,
              add=TRUE, filled=FALSE )</c>
            </p>
          </task>
        </task>
      </task>

      <task workspace="10%">
        <p>
          You can add more contours by
          including parameters such as
          <c>levels=c(3)</c>, or
          <c>levels=c(1,7.5,12)</c>
          in the <c>plotFun</c> command from
          part <xref ref="add_contours" />.
          Keep adding contours until you find
          one that appears to be tangent to the
          constraint.
          Write down the command(s)
          you used to get the desired contour.
        </p>
      </task>

      <task>
        <p>
          To get a closer look,
          adjust the viewing window to zoom
          in on the point where the constraint
          appears tangent to a contour by
          including an <c>x.lim</c> parameter
          in the <c>plotFun</c> command from
          part <xref ref="plot_constraint" />.
        </p>
      </task>

      <task workspace="10%">
        <p>
          Describe the constrained critical
          point that you found.

        Use the techniques outlined in the previous problem to find the optimal points for
        the objective function <m>f(x,y) = 3x^2 + 4y^2</m> on the curve <m>x+2y = 3</m>.
        The space
        below is left blank for you to make any notes you might find useful in repeating
        this procedure later.
