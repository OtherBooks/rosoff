        The table below gives the cost, <m>C</m>
        (in dollars),
        of driving
        500 miles as a function of the price, <m>x</m>
        (in dollars per gallon),
        and the
        fuel economy, <m>y</m>
        (in miles per gallon or mpg),
        of the car.
        Sketch contours
        for <m>C = 45</m>, <m>55</m>,
        <m>65</m>, and so on, up through <m>105</m>, directly on the
        table.
